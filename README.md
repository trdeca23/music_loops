# INSTRUCTIONS:


1. Create a working directory for the project with the name of your choice.



2. Make sure `main.py`, `read_functions.py`, as well as the `Scientist_Testdata` directory which includes all the data. Note that the latter directory cointaining data isn't online so if you don't already have it you won't be able to run these scripts. You can get the `.py` scripts by cloning the GitHub repository https://github.com/trdeca23/music_loops to your working directory.



3. Install required libraries to your environment. Required libraries are:
  * os
  * pandas
  * sklearn
  * matplotlib



4. Make sure that correct paths and names are specified for:
  * `project_path`, specified at the top of `main.py` script, should point to your project's working directory
  * make sure `xml_path` and `csv_path` just below that are correctly specified as well, pointing to the `.xml` and `.csv` data, respectively

5. Run `main.py`. This will call the other .py scripts to compute positions and visualize them.





# NOTES: 

- Ran this on my Mac ..I don't think I've used any os specific protocols.
